        <div class="intro">
        Hello. So most of my design experience was in laying out a page until the past 1-1.5 years. Before then, I redesigned web sites for my high school paper, college paper, and the JHU Office of Sustainability. When I was hired as a software engineer February 2013, I was asked to learn web development and was evaluated on how quickly and independently I could learn. I made the cut and was hired as a software engineer, kept in mind for design projects. Since then, I went on to redesign Vigilant Medical's marketing site, revamped their marketing assets, and provided front-end engineering and design support.

       		The Bohemian Monthly Magazine

        <div class="description">
        	The Bohemian Monthly Magazine was a three-issue magazine project conceived of, designed, and started by Stephanie Delman and me while we were at Hopkins. Stephanie Delman was a former co-editor at The News-Letter. I have very few copies left of the second edition and will be dropping off physical copies of the first and third issues. I have linked an <a href="http://issuu.com/thebohemian/docs/marchbohemian"> issuu version </a>of the second issue.

       	</div>
        <div class="description">
        	I worked as the communications person (full time when I took a semester off from school and as an intern when I went back to school). There I contributed graphic design, copy writing, news gathering, and print and social media marketing and communications. I created branding packages and promotional resources for university-wide campaigns and sustainability awareness. I spent some time of my time there redesigning their website (if only we still had an example of what we had to work with still living online), and it was mostly on a consulting/strategy/content generation role. We had to consult with the web development team out of Hopkins to do the actual work, but most of the parts that I came up with are still at <a href="http://www.sustainability.jhu.edu/">sustainability.jhu.edu</a>.

            My design sample from my time here are some of the branding materials I designed for JHU's Earth Week 2012. The logo appeared on all promotional materials across every JHU campus. You can click on the samples to see larger examples of the work.

        	I designed the working logo of Boomerang Geospatial for Maggie. Before she left on her sabbatical to Africa, she asked me to integrate the logo into a business card, which you can see <a href="work/Maggie/maggie-bcard.pdf">here</a>.

       		Vigilant Medical
       </div>
       <div class="description">
       		Last summer, I put to use some of those peripheral aesthetics that I felt so much about and the web development I had just learned. You can see the product of that effort on <a href="http://vigilantmedical.net">vigilantmedical.net</a>. I started with <a href="http://ie.vigilantmedical.net">our old marketing site</a> and reworked our concept, defined our web strategy, and came up with new messaging and branding. I mostly just told everyone at the office what I was doing and then I did it. I designed the website from start to finish and most of the icons you see on the site were made by me in Adobe Illustrator. All of the graphics were made by me. I took our basic marketing words and I rewrote them. My intern did the slider and the header javascript, but I'm working on a new animation method right now. It's about as handcrafted as you can get for building a marketing web site. Since releasing the site, we've done better with SEO (take that, WordPress), which is a "success" in everyone else's eyes. <b>Keep in mind:</b> this was the first website I built from scratch, since I usually build things within our app. I wanted to build it from scratch so I could learn how to. I'm re-releasing a more compatible version so it'd be nice if you looked at the current site in Chrome or Safari, and keep in mind that there will be a new version in the future. Internet Explorer has too many quirks, and some parts of the site are quirky, hence the rebuilding from scratch bit.
            <br />
            <br />
            I also am dropping off a physical copy of a mailer I made. Vigilant Medical's goal is to eliminate CDs from a hospital workflow...our vanilla product's motto is "eliminate CDs, enhance referrals." So our sales guy thought it would be cute to make our mailers in the form of a CD sleeve, like the ones that you get at a hospital. I got some basic inspiration from the CD sleeve he got from JHU Radiology, and made... <a href="work/Vigilant/CDmailer-final.pdf">a CD sleeve mailer!</a>. You can see the project's process <a href="http://thisispayal.github.io/project-hub">here</a>, but it's nothing special. I like to practice making web sites whenever I can, so I've started to make these timelines as a sort of design Github so people can see my progress and design decisions...and we don't have like 20 versions of one thing floating around.
            
            <br />
            The rest of my web development work is inside the app, which means it's not really accessible to the public. However, I hope these were enough samples. Let me know whether you'd like to see some more.
