        <div class="intro">
        Hello. Most of my design experience was in laying out a page until the past 1-1.5 years. Before then, I redesigned web sites for my high school paper, college paper, and the JHU Office of Sustainability. When I was hired as a software engineer February 2013, I was asked to learn web development and was evaluated on how quickly I could learn. They seemed to think it was adequate enough, since they hired me. Since then, I went on to redesign Vigilant Medical's marketing site, revamped their marketing assets, and provided front-end engineering and design support.

       		The Bohemian Monthly Magazine
       	</div>
        <div class="description">
        	The Bohemian Monthly Magazine was a three-issue magazine project conceived of, designed, and started by Stephanie Delman, my former co-editor at the JHU News-Letter, and me while we were at Hopkins. I have very few copies left of the second edition and will be dropping off physical copies of the first and third issues. I have linked an <a href="http://issuu.com/thebohemian/docs/marchbohemian"> issuu version </a>of the second issue.

        <div class="description">
        	I worked as the communications person (full time when I took off a semester from school and as an intern when I went back to school). There I contributed graphic design, copy writing, news gathering, and print and social media marketing and communications. I created marketing tools, branding packages, and promotional resources for university-wide campaigns and sustainability awareness. I spent some time of my time there redesigning their website (if only we still had an example of what we had to work with still living online), and it was mostly on a consulting/strategy/content generation role. We had to consult with the web development team out of Hopkins, but most of the parts that I came up with are still at <a href="http://www.sustainability.jhu.edu/">sustainability.jhu.edu</a>. My design sample from my time here are some of the branding materials I designed for JHU's Earth Week 2012. The logo appeared on all promotional materials across every JHU campus.

        	I designed the working logo of Boomerang Geospatial for Maggie. Before she left on her sabbatical to Africa, she asked me to integrate the logo into a business card, which you can see <a href="work/Maggie/maggie-bcard.pdf">here</a>.

       		Vigilant Medical
       </div>
       <div class="description">
       		Last summer, I put to use some of those peripheral aesthetics that I felt so much about and the web development I had just learned. You can see the product of that effort on <a href="http://vigilantmedical.net">vigilantmedical.net</a>. I started with <a href="ie.vigilantmedical.net">our old marketing site</a> and reworked our concept, defined our web strategy, and came up with new messaging and branding. I mostly just told everyone at the office what I was doing and then I did it. I designed the website from start to finish and most of the icons you see on the site were made by me in Adobe Illustrator. All of the graphics were made by me. I took our basic marketing words and I rewrote them. It's about as handcrafted as you can get for building a marketing web site. Since releasing the site, we've done better with SEO (take that, WordPress), which is a "success" in everyone else's eyes. <b>Keep in mind:</b> this was the first website I built from scratch, since I usually build things within our app. I wanted to build it from scratch so I could learn how to. I'm re-releasing a more compatible version (i.e. racing against time to rebuild this site from scratch) before I leave my office at the end of the week. So it'd be nice if you looked at it in Chrome or Safari. Internet Explorer has too many quirks, hence the rebuilding from scratch bit.

            I also am dropping off a physical copy of a mailer I made. Vigilant Medical's goal is to eliminate CDs from a hospital workflow...our vanilla product's motto is "eliminate CDs, enhance referrals." So our sales guy thought it would be cute to make our mailers in the form of a CD sleeve, like the ones that you get at a hospital. I got some basic inspiration from the CD sleeve he got from JHU Radiology, and made <a href="work/Vigilant/CDmailer-final.pdf">this</a>. You can see the project's process <a href="http://thisispayal.github.io/project-hub">here</a>, but it's nothing special. I like to practice making web sites whenever I can, so I've started to make these timelines as a sort of design Github so people can see my progress and design decisions...and we don't have like 20 versions of one thing floating around.
