        Hello. A little bit about my web design background, since that's what you're mostly interested in. Most of my design experience was in laying out a page until the past 1-1.5 years. Before then, I redesigned web sites for my high school paper, college paper, and the JHU Office of Sustainability. When I was hired as a software engineer February 2013, I was asked to learn web development and tested on how quickly I could learn. They seemed to think it was adequate enough, since they hired me. Since then, I I went on to redesign their marketing site and read up a lot on front end web development.

        <div class="description">
        	The Bohemian Monthly Magazine was a three-issue magazine project conceived of, designed, and started by Stephanie Delman, my former co-editor at the JHU News-Letter, and me while we were at Hopkins. I have very few copies left of the second edition and will be dropping off physical copies of the first and third issues. Here's an issuu version of the second issue: <a href="http://issuu.com/thebohemian/docs/marchbohemian"> Click me!</a>

        <div class="description">
        	I worked as the communications person (full time when I took off a semester from school and as an intern when I went back to school). There I contributed graphic design, copy writing, news gathering, and print and social media marketing and communications. I created marketing tools, branding packages, and promotional resources for university-wide campaigns and sustainability awareness. I spent some time of my time there redesigning their website (if only we still had an example of what we had to work with still living online), and it was mostly on a consulting/strategy/content generation role. We had to consult with the web development team out of Hopkins, but most of the parts that I came up with are still at <a href="http://www.sustainability.jhu.edu/">sustainability.jhu.edu</a>. My design sample from my time here is the logo I designed for JHU's Earth Week 2012. This logo appeared on all promotional materials across every JHU campus.

        	I designed the working logo of Boomerang Geospatial for Maggie. Before she left on her sabbatical to Africa, she asked me to integrate the logo into a business card, which you can see <a href="work/Maggie/maggie-bcard.pdf">here</a>.
